# FASERnu_pilot-analysis
MinniVan/FASERnu-pilot_analysis
This repo contains a jupyterNB for comparing MC simulation of 500k muons(mu-) events in a 529(mm)^2 area, with pilot run data collected in 2018 with roughly the same area (there are more events in data than MC). 

To run analysis, you must download this folder here containing MC simulation and pilot data outside: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y-s-zBt5F814pEYeez_6U1WAKdxTqPiK?usp=sharing
